# Working with Direct Bound Ports in Orchestrations: Self-correlating direct bound ports
Direct bound ports are logical one-way or two-way ports that you can use inside your orchestration that are not explicitly bound to physical ports. This will allow you to have different communication patterns among your services.  

## Self-correlating direct bound ports
Self-correlating direct bound ports assist you in designing asynchronous inter-orchestration communication.  Messages sent to a self-correlating direct bound port are routed to the instance of the orchestration that created the receiving end of the self-correlated direct bound port.
