# Working with Orchestrations
## Handling Exceptions inside BizTalk Orchestrations
Project explaining how to Handling Exceptions inside BizTalk Orchestrations. Handling exceptions inside orchestration is the equivalent of doing a “catch { }” block in C#, of course, there are some little differences, but the idea is the same.

## How to call a SQL Stored procedure without inputs
In this proof-of-concept (PoC) we will have a simple SQL Server table called Codes that only contains a code identifier that is unique in the system, as you can see picture bellow and, once again, we will try to call a stored procedure that gets all the existing codes.

## How to call Orchestration from another project or from another BizTalk Application
Project explaining how to call Orchestration from another project or from another BizTalk Application.

## How to Call Orchestrations developed in a different Visual Studio Solution
In the past, I developed a demo on “How to Call Orchestration from another project or from another BizTalk Application” that you can read here and download the source code from Code Gallery here.

However, there were a few questions about how we can accomplish that using two different solutions… well is the exact same process, but to help clarify this topic and to better help the community members that placed the questions I decide to create a different demo.

## Customize filename dynamically inside BizTalk Orchestration
Project explaining how to Customize filename dynamically inside BizTalk Orchestration. This is a basic step and to accomplish this you only have to define the message context property of the output message.

## POC: BizTalk - Count XML Nodes Inside Orchestrations
