# Working with Direct Bound Ports in Orchestrations: Partner direct bound ports
Direct bound ports are logical one-way or two-way ports that you can use inside your orchestration that are not explicitly bound to physical ports. This will allow you to have different communication patterns among your services.  

## Partner direct bound ports
Partner direct bound ports provide for inter-orchestration communication via Logical Ports.  Messages sent on a direct bound port can be sent to an intended recipient orchestration, and messages received on a partner direct bound port can be received from an intended sender orchestration.
