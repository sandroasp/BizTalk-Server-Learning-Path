# Working with Direct Bound Ports in Orchestrations: Message Box direct bound
Direct bound ports are logical one-way or two-way ports that you can use inside your orchestration that are not explicitly bound to physical ports. This will allow you to have different communication patterns among your services.  

## Message Box direct bound ports
Message Box direct bound ports allow you to implement publish-subscribe design patterns.  Messages sent on an Orchestration to a Message Box direct bound port are published to the BizTalk Server Message Box database without any explicit intent of the message recipients.
